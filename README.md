# Advanced_Data_Structures
This repository contains some advanced data structure libraries developed by me in a much simpler way. This repository gets updated from time to time whenever i come across some other new data structures.

The repository has the codes for following Data structures
* [Segment tree](https://github.com/Ram-Mohan333/Advanced_Data_Structures/blob/main/segtree.cpp) 
* [Trie](https://github.com/Ram-Mohan333/Advanced_Data_Structures/blob/main/trie.cpp) 
* [Union Find Disjoint Set](https://github.com/Ram-Mohan333/Advanced_Data_Structures/blob/main/union_find.cpp)
